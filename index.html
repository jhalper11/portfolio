        <p>
          I am a hard working, reliable individual who has excelled in previous positions of leadership and responsibility. As a junior at the University of Michigan School of Information my area of focus is information analysis, with coursework covering topics such as data manipulation, economic theory, and web accessibility. I've also taken up a minor in Business through the Stephen M. Ross School of Business to develop my skills in critical thinking, decision making, and quantitative reasoning.
